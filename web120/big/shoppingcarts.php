Many people believe that shopping carts was a successful invention because it made easier to be able to answer the problems of the normal shopping cart that people see in different stores. “Other shopping aids would require more cooperation between sites. You might, for example, want to browse recipes from an online grocer (who would get those recipes from an online bookstore), then choose one and have the cart immediately contain the ingredients. (The bookstore could also offer a deal on the book from which it drew the recipe.) Though this level of cart intelligence would require a great deal of work to implement, it could also return a great deal of value to those online merchants that offered it”.

Shopping carts are much easily connected. “Shopping cart" is a term that has come to mean one of two things: first, an online ordering system that is separate from an e-commerce website, and second, a store-building system that can be used to build and manage both an e-commerce site's web pages and its ordering system”.
